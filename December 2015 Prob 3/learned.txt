    I should use the modular approach while coding. It makes debugging easier. It makes the code easier to read. It
makes it easier to write
    I should use print while debugging.  I can check if a section is working or not by seeing if the output is the
expected value.
    I shouldn't give up while debugging. Be persistent and try to get the problem done. If I can't solve the problem on
my own, ask for help.
